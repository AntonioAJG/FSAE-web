    <h1>About Formula SAE</h1>

    <p>
      Formula SAE (FSAE) is an international engineering design competition organized by SAE International. It challenges university students to design, build, and test a small-scale formula-style race car. The goal is to provide participants with hands-on experience in engineering, teamwork, and project management by simulating the environment of a real-world motorsport development team.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students work in multidisciplinary teams that include mechanical, electrical, computer, industrial, and business backgrounds. These teams take full responsibility for their vehicle, including its design, manufacturing, and performance validation. The experience helps bridge the gap between academic theory and practical application.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the Competition</h2>
    <p>
      The main objective of Formula SAE is to prepare students for careers in mobility-related industries. Participants are expected not only to demonstrate technical excellence but also to present their design's financial, strategic, and market feasibility to a panel of industry professionals.
    </p>

    <h2>Vehicle Development</h2>
    <p>
      Teams develop high-performance vehicles that must comply with a strict set of rules emphasizing safety, reliability, innovation, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. These cars typically feature lightweight chassis, efficient suspension systems, high-performance powertrains (combustion or electric), integrated electronics, and tailored driver ergonomics.
    </p>

    <h2>Competition Categories</h2>
    <p>
      Formula SAE includes both static and dynamic events:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Static Events:</strong> Design Presentation, Cost & Manufacturing Analysis, and Business Presentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Dynamic Events:</strong> Acceleration (0â€“75m), Skid Pad (lateral grip), Autocross (handling), Endurance (22 km performance test), and Efficiency (energy consumption analysis).</p>

    <h2>Areas of Participation</h2>
    <p>
      Teams cover a wide range of technical and organizational domains, including: powertrain development, chassis design, aerodynamics, suspension tuning, embedded systems, energy management (for EVs), data acquisition, marketing, sponsorship, logistics, financial planning, and public relations.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Reach</h2>
    <p>
      Formula SAE is held in various regions worldwide, with events such as Formula SAE Michigan (USA), Formula Student Germany, Formula Bharat (India), Formula SAE Australasia, and Formula Student UK. While the rules remain mostly standardized, regional competitions may introduce variations, particularly in electric and autonomous vehicle categories.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Participation in Formula SAE equips students with the ability to apply classroom concepts to real-world engineering challenges. It fosters critical soft skills such as time management, collaboration, and communication under pressure. Moreover, students gain valuable exposure to professional tools, industry contacts, and real feedback from experts in the automotive and motorsport sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many FSAE alumni have gone on to work at leading organizations such as Tesla, Red Bull Racing, Mercedes-AMG, Ford, Bosch, and other top companies across the automotive and tech industries.
